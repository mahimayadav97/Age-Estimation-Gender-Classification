# Age and Gender Prediction Model

This project is designed to predict the age and gender of individuals from images using deep learning techniques. The model has been trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and is capable of classifying images into age and gender categories.

## Project Overview

The project includes an **IPython Notebook** (`.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to use the trained model for predictions on sample images. The notebook also explains the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation process.

### Model Files

The trained model files are large and hosted on Google Drive for easy access:

- [Download Model B: age_gender_B.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4fT6Hi4b4rAXqxm5WAmQlH0N92rVU1S/view?usp=sharing)

### Requirements

This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

- TensorFlow (for model training and inference)
- Keras (high-level neural network API)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
